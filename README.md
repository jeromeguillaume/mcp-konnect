## Overview

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Kong Konnect's API Gateway. It offers a set of tools to query analytics data, inspect configuration details, and manage control planes through natural language conversation.

Key features:
- Query API request analytics with customizable filters
- List and inspect gateway services, routes, consumers, and plugins
- Manage control planes and control plane groups
- Integration with Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants

Konnect MCP is a **work in progress** and we will be adding additional functionality and improvements with each release.

## MCP Server Docker

npm run build
```

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables to configure the MCP server:

```bash
# Required: Your Kong Konnect API key
export KONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN=kpat_api_key_here

# Optional: The API region to use (defaults to US)
# Possible values: US, EU, AU, ME, IN
export KONNECT_REGION=us
```

- size: Number of routes to return
- offset: Pagination offset token
```

#### List Consumers
List all consumers associated with a control plane.

```
Inputs:

- size: Number of consumers to return
- offset: Pagination offset token
```

#### List Plugins
List all plugins associated with a control plane.

```
Inputs:

- size: Number of plugins to return
- offset: Pagination offset token
```

### Control Planes Tools

#### List Control Planes
List all control planes in your organization.

```
Inputs:
- pageSize: Number of control planes per page
- pageNumber: Page number to retrieve

```
Inputs:
- controlPlaneId: ID of the control plane to retrieve
```

#### List Control Plane Group Memberships
List all control planes that are members of a specific group.

```
Inputs:
- groupId: Control plane group ID
- pageSize: Number of members to return per page
- pageAfter: Cursor for pagination
```

#### Check Control Plane Group Membership
Check if a control plane is a member of any group.

```
Inputs:
- controlPlaneId: Control plane ID to check
```

## Usage with Claude

To use this MCP server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Install [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Create or edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kong-konnect": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/mcp-konnect/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "KONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "kpat_api_key_here",
        "KONNECT_REGION": "us"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude for Desktop
5. The Kong Konnect tools will now be available for Claude to use

## Example Workflows

### Analyzing API Traffic

1. First, list all control planes:
   ```
   Please list all control planes in my Kong Konnect organization.
   ```

2. Then, list services for a specific control plane:
   ```
   List all services for control plane [CONTROL_PLANE_NAME/ID].
   ```
   
3. Query API requests for a specific service:
   ```
   Show me all API requests for service [SERVICE_NAME/ID] in the last hour that had 5xx status codes.
   ```

### Troubleshooting Consumer Issues

1. List consumers for a control plane:
   ```
   List all consumers for control plane [CONTROL_PLANE_NAME/ID].
   ```

2. Analyze requests for a specific consumer:
   ```
   Show me all requests made by consumer [CONSUMER_NAME/ID] in the last 24 hours.
   ```

3. Check for common errors or patterns:
   ```
   What are the most common errors experienced by this consumer?
   ```

## Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Define the parameters in `parameters.ts`
2. Add documentation in `prompts.ts`
3. Create the operation logic in the appropriate file in `operations/`
4. Register the tool in `tools.ts`
5. Handle the tool execution in `index.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors**
- Verify your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
- Check that the API region is correctly specified
- Ensure your network can connect to the Kong Konnect API

**Authentication Errors**
- Regenerate your API key in the Kong Konnect portal
- Check that environment variables are correctly set

**Data Not Found**
- Verify the IDs used in requests are correct
- Check that the resources exist in the specified control plane
- Ensure time ranges are valid for analytics queries
